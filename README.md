# Go

This is a generic Go engine used to launch [Nanobox](http://nanobox.io).

##### NOTE: This Engine is a Work in Progress
If you're interested in helping to complete this engine, answers to the questions in [this issue](https://github.com/nanobox-io/nanobox-engine-golang/issues/5) would be great.*

## App Detection
To detect a Go app, this engine checks for the presence of a `Gomfile`, `main.go`, or files with the `.go` extension.
